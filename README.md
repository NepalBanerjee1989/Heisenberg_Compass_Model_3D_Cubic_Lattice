# Heisenberg_Compass_Model_3D_Cubic_Lattice
Here we have simulated Heisenberg-Compass model with classical spin in a cubic lattice.We have used classical monte-carlo simulation and use Metropolish spin flipping algorithm.We have here explored order by disorder mechanism and observed bond-directional ordering.
